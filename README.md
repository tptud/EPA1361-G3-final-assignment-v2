The important added modules from the base model include the following:
Exploration, this is were the problem exploration happend. The missing figure is added.
MORDOR, This was our orignal MORDM analysis.
MORDOR2, This is the MORDM analysis that was redone for the retake purposes. It is based on the original code, but more extensive.

The envirmont exist mostly out of the EMA_workbech version 2.4.1 recommend installation on python 3.11.

The MORDOR 2 file takes long to run from top to bottom and wasnt's cleanly redone before submitting because of computational time problems.
The expected time for our pc was 48 hours of uninterrupted with no other activity on the pc. The main PC to do this on broke during develepmont and is being repaired.
